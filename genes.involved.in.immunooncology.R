  "IL7R", # in pan-T ranked as a marker. However, expressed in almost all cd8&4 except exhausted [1~3]. involved in VDJ recombination [4]. suggested in Melanoma & BCC, could be skin-cancer enriched? [5] but not validated in [6]. Don't suggest to use when assigning clusters. Could use in retrospection. In fact, almost useless in defining Naive.
