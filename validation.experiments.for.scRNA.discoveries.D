# 1 
# PURPOSE 
# - to validate functions of computationally discovered clusters [76]
# PROTOCOL
# - coculture of isolated TILs with autologous cancer cells, in the presence or abscence of CD3/CD28 activation:
# - use FACS to isolate your identified cluster based on your computational markers, 
# - check IFNG, CCL5 expression etc for validation of the proposed functions


# 2
# PURPOSE
# - to identify proliferative T cell & daugther cells [82]
# PROTOCOL
# - mouse, use incorporated idU,
